# shop-BE
This is my submission for the Shopify Infrastructure Engineering and Backend Development internship since they both have the same technical challenge. My extra feature was: ability to assign/remove inventory items to a named group/collection.
To run my code:
1. Make sure you have `python3` installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Make sure you have `pip` installed
3. Run `pip install django`
4. Download my code as a zip file from github and shop-BE-main and then cd into studybud
5. Run `python3 manage.py run server 8001` and click on the link
6. Play around with my application!

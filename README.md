# shop-BE
This is my submission for the Shopify Infrastructure Engineering and Backend Development internship since they both have the same technical challenge. My extra feature was: ability to assign/remove inventory items to a named group/collection.
To run my code:
1. Make sure you have `python3` installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Make sure you have `pip` installed (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
3. Run `pip install django` in your terminal
4. Download my code as a zip file from github and then run `cd shop-BE-main` in your terminal (make sure you're in the same folder as where you store your `shop-BE-main` folder and then `cd` into `studybud`)
5. Run `python3 manage.py runserver 8001` and click on the link
6. Play around with my application!
